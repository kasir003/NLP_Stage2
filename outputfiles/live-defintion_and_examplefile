And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first ; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind , and sour the temper . Those who can barely <head>live</head> , and who live perforce in a very small , and generally very inferior , society , may well be illiberal and cross . This does not apply , however , to Miss Bates ; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me ; but , in general , she is very much to the taste of every body , though single and though poor .

Defintion is :
a know or said 
Example is: 
I grant you , that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta , and indeed it could not be ; he is the only one that could be possible ; but he is a very good - natured , good sort of a fellow ; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands , he will make a different sort of place of it , and <head>live</head> in a very different sort of way ; and with that property , he will never be a contemptible man -- good , freehold property . No , no ; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter ; and if she has him , and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth , I shall be very well satisfied ."

Example is: 
After many years of this pleasant living , the pond became very low , in a dry season ; and finally it dried up . The two Ducks saw that they could no longer <head>live</head> there , so they decided to fly to another region , where there was more water . They went to the Tortoise to bid her good - bye .

He took that fat trout away from me and ate it just as if it belonged to him ! I hate him ! If I <head>live</head> long enough I ' m going to get even with him !" Of course that wasn ' t nice talk and anything but a nice spirit , but Little Joe Otter ' s temper is sometimes pretty short , especially when he is hungry , and this time he had had no breakfast , you know .
