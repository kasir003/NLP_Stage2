Defintion is :
the know or said 
Example is: 
After such behaviour , as I have witnessed during the last month , to Miss Smith -- such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this <head>manner</head> -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which I had not supposed possible ! Believe me , sir , I am far , very far , from gratified in being the object of such professions ."

Defintion is :
the know or said 
Example is: 
" Well , well , I am ready ;"-- and turning again to Emma , " but you must not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man ; you have only had _my_ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary :"-- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction . Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent , and answer in a <head>manner</head> that appropriated nothing . " Think of me to - morrow , my dear Emma , about four o ' clock ," was Mrs . Weston ' s parting injunction ; spoken with some anxiety , and meant only for her .

Defintion is :
the friend or well 
Example is: 
" You , who have been the best friend I ever had in my life -- Want gratitude to you !-- Nobody is equal to you !-- I care for nobody as I do for you !-- Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been !" Such expressions , assisted as they were by every thing that look and <head>manner</head> could do , made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well , nor valued her affection so highly before . " There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart ," said she afterwards to herself .
