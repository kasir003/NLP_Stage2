   It basically has all the senseval-2 files of our team.
12.Output
    DefinitionandExamples : Contains all the definition and example text files.
    Keyfiles: Has the original manual key files and system generated output
              key files which can be used for senseclusters_scorer
    It also has all the output senseval-2 files.

PROBLEM 
--------

This section gives details about the problem at hand:

The problem for this project is to create a dictionary from input raw text. 
The input for the system will be some instances (sentences), containing the 
target word, whose meaning has to be determined. The system created as a 
solution must cluster the input instances into N clusters, where N is 
automatically selected by the system. Also the system should give a meaning 
to each of these automatically created clusters and pick an example from the
input instances for each of these clusters. The system should only use the 
input instances containing the target word, along with some random text from
any corpus if needed.

The input file to the system is an xml in senseval 2 format. There are 2 
kinds of input xml files: one of the file contains only one target word which is
either a noun or a verb and the other is a nameconflate xml input file which has 
two target words conflated into one word. The system should automatically cluster 
them into different cluster and give a meaning and also pick an example for 
each cluster.

Then we pick up the first sentence from each cluster as an example, as a part
of the baseline approach. Also we then use the most occuring feature word as
the meaning of each cluster, as a part of the baseline approach.

---------------------------
SOLUTION - BASELINE SYSTEM
---------------------------

The Idea is to cluster the sentences based on the local context vectors rather than the global context vectors. To Identify the clusters we are considering the words, which are selected based on number of occurences in the local context.This top  words act as dimensions(will be called dimension words in the rest of document) for generating the local context vectors for every instance of the file. As the generated vector matrix can be very sparse , Singular Value Decomposition is used to reduce the dimensionality of the context vector matrix . The resultant vector matrix from SVD is thus clustered using Hierarchical Clustering approach which inturn uses the Ward's minimum variance method to calculate the distance between the vectors.

System extracts the instances from the input file. System tokenizes all the instances , removes all the punctuations and stop words from the instances and then each sentence is represented as a list of words.Then the system goes through all the words and pick the top frequent words as the dimension for the context vectors. It removes target word from the dimension. Once the list with top words is generated, the system then generates int vectors with top words as dimensions. So for each sentence we have a context vector: a value of 1 represents that the corresponding dimension word is there in the sentence and 0 represents otherwise.

Example: dimension words=[hello, how, word, natural]:  contextvector=[0 0 1 1] : It means that the sentence has words word and natural in it.
 
Once the context vectors are generated for each sentence, singular value decomposition factorizes the sparse context vector matrix and generates a new matrix. Which then is clustered based on Ward's minimum variance method. We use the scipy toolkit for clustering. Scipy has methods for hierarchical clustering and we use the ward variance method and the distance metric is euclidean.

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
-----------------------

This section gives details about how to run the program:

1) Open Terminal
2) Navigate to the location of the UMDuluth-CS8761-Rome folder.
3) To run the project, runit.sh script should be used. 
4) The runit.sh script has few variables to setup before 
   executing the script on terminal
5) INPUTFILE variable takes in the location of the input senseval-2
   format xml file.
6) The next variable is to setup the location of senseclusters_scorer 
    program and the name of the variable is SENSE_CLUSTERS_SCORER_LOCATION,
    by default it is set to something and the tar file has the 
    sense_cluster_scorer program, so there is no need to change it.
7) To run the main.py python script , need to pass input file name along with "-i" option 
 

------------------
INPUT FILE FORMAT 
------------------

The Primary input for the program is Senseval-2 file format file. 
Three different xml files created by each individual of the team are :
1. A two words, name-conflate pair xml file.
2. Noun xml file.
3. Verb xml file.

Example format for name-conflate pair xml file :
-----------------------------------------------
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" ?>
 <corpus lang='english'>

 <lexelt item="p_h">

 <instance id="1">
 <answer instance="1" senseid="priest"/>
 <context>
  at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale. 14:18 And 
  Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and 
  he was the  <head>p_h</head> of the most high God.  14:19 
  And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high 
  God, possessor of     heaven and earth: 
 </context>
 </instance>
 </lexelt>
 </corpus>

Example format for Noun or Verb file :
---------------------------------------
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" ?>
 <corpus lang='english'>

 <lexelt item="G">

 <instance id="1">
 <answer instance="1" senseid="Supreme_Power"/>
 <context>
 In the beginning <head>God</head> created the heaven and the earth.
 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon 
 the face of the deep. And the 
 </context>
 </instance>
 </lexelt>
 </corpus>


-------------------
OUTPUT FILE FORMAT
-------------------

Three different types of Output files will be generated by this system
1.Output definition and example text file
2.Output key file
3.Input key file


1.Output text file: It contains a definition and an example for 
each sense of the target word. The name of this file will be in 
the format as word-definition.text

Example: 
--------
Definition and Examples for God

Defintion is :
either earth or made 
Example is: 
the name of the LORD. This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of <head>God</head> made he him; Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. And 

2.Output Key file: It is generated from the output xml file. 
It acts as input to the Sensecluster Scorer program.
Example:
--------
God   God.1   God.4 
God   God.2   God.1 
God   God.3   God.1 
God   God.4   God.1 
God   God.5   God.1 

3.Input Key file: It is generated from the input xml file. 
It acts as input to the Sensecluster Scorer Program.

Example:
--------
God   God.1   God.Supreme_Power
God   God.2   God.Supreme_Power
God   God.3   God.Supreme_Power
God   God.4   God.Supreme_Power
God   God.5   God.Supreme_Power
God   God.6   God.Supreme_Power
